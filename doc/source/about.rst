Orchd Architecture
------------------


.. note::
    A more detailed view of the Orchd's architecture can be found here: `Orchd Documentation: Architecture <https://orchd.readthedocs.io>`_

The Orchd solution was architected to work as an integrator for Edge and IoT environments. Its two base premises
are: "standardization takes time", "without standardization integration is necessary". Orchd stands for
"Orchestration Daemon" its intention is to integrate and orchestrate services that barely or cannot communicate with
each other.

Orchd development is centered on its architecture, and invites developers to add its own extensions and set the
interaction between different systems. With this in mind, `Orchd` offers an SDK to support developers on the process
of extending `Orchd`.

In this documentation you will learn how to use the `orchd-sdk` CLI command to create your extensions.
